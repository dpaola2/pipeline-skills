## 1. Project Overview

### Goals
- Every user-visible reference to "Landing Page(s)" in the web admin says "Public Page(s)" instead
- Zero customer confusion about the feature name during beta rollout
- Zero functional or behavioral changes — this is purely cosmetic

### Scope Summary

| Area | Description | Platform |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Sidebar navigation | Update link text in Bootstrap and Tailwind sidebars | Web |
| Page headings & titles | Update headings on index, new, edit, show, archived pages | Web |
| Buttons & links | Update button labels, action links, CTA text | Web |
| Flash messages & confirmations | Update all create/update/archive/restore/duplicate messages and confirm dialogs | Web |
| Area assignment UI | Update labels in structure right pane and bulk assign modal | Web |
| Admin settings | Update feature flag checkbox label | Web |
| Tests | Update string assertions in specs to match new text | Web |

### Out of Scope
- Renaming database tables (`landing_pages`, `landing_page_sections`, `landing_page_section_forms`)
- Renaming model classes (`LandingPage`, `LandingPageSection`, `LandingPageSectionForm`)
- Renaming controllers or controller files
- Changing URL routes (`/setup/landing_pages` stays as-is)
- Renaming Stimulus controller identifier (`landing-page-edit`)
- Renaming feature flag column (`landing_pages_enabled`)
- Renaming factories, helpers, services, or internal test references
- Any behavioral or functional changes
- iOS or Android changes (Level 2 web-only project)

### Constraints & Conventions
- AGENTS.md: `~/projects/orangeqc/orangeqc/AGENTS.md`
- Only user-facing strings change — all code identifiers remain `landing_page*`
- Feature is behind `landing_pages_enabled` flag — no new flag needed

## 2. Open Questions & Decisions

| Question | Status | Decision |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Has the rename decision been finalized by Matt and Dave? (PM-226) | Resolved | Yes — approved to proceed (architecture approval notes) |
| Should test files be updated as part of this project? | Resolved | Yes — update test assertions alongside the strings to keep the suite green |
| Should the public-facing page (QR code visitor view) display "Public Page" anywhere? | Resolved | No — the public page doesn't currently show the feature name; no changes needed |

## 3. Functional Milestones

### M0: Discovery & Alignment (Complete)
- [x] PRD parsed and understood (Stage 1)
- [x] Current state documented — all ~51 user-facing string occurrences inventoried (Stage 1)
- [x] Architecture proposed and **approved** — direct string replacement, no data model/API changes (Stage 2)
- [x] Open questions resolved (Stages 1-2)

---

### M1: Rename User-Facing Strings
**What:** Replace all user-facing occurrences of "Landing Page(s)" with "Public Page(s)" across controllers, views, and JavaScript. Update test assertions to match.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] NAV-001: The Tailwind setup sidebar link reads "Public Pages" instead of "Landing Pages"
- [ ] NAV-002: The Bootstrap setup sidebar link reads "Public Pages" instead of "Landing Pages"
- [ ] NAV-003: The archived pages back-link reads "Back to Public Pages"
- [ ] HDG-001: The index page heading reads "Public Pages"
- [ ] HDG-002: The new page heading reads "New Public Page"
- [ ] HDG-003: The edit page heading reads "Edit Public Page"
- [ ] HDG-004: The archived index page heading reads "Archived Public Pages"
- [ ] HDG-005: The show page does not display "Landing Page" anywhere (confirm dialogs, archived banner)
- [ ] BTN-001: The "New Public Page" button appears on the index page (text and title attribute)
- [ ] BTN-002: The "Duplicate" action in the structures right pane reads "Duplicate Public Page"
- [ ] BTN-003: The archive confirm dialog references "public page" (both with and without area assignments)
- [ ] BTN-004: The "Restore" action works and flash says "Public page was restored successfully."
- [ ] BTN-005: The area tree right pane heading reads "Public Page" and all labels reference "public page"
- [ ] BTN-006: The bulk assign modal heading uses "Public Page" and success message says "Public page assigned to X area(s) successfully."
- [ ] MSG-001: All flash messages (create, update, archive, restore, duplicate) say "Public page" instead of "Landing page"
- [ ] MSG-002: All confirmation dialogs reference "public page" (remove from area, replace assignment, archive with areas)
- [ ] FLG-001: The admin account settings checkbox label reads "Public Pages" instead of "Landing Pages"
- [ ] All empty state text references "public pages" (index empty state, archived empty state, no assigned page)
- [ ] Search placeholder reads "Search public pages..."
- [ ] Pagination model name reads "public page" / "archived public page"
- [ ] Form placeholder reads "Public page title"
- [ ] Section form picker help text reads "...when you save the public page."
- [ ] All existing landing pages tests pass with the updated strings
- [ ] Running `grep -ri "landing page" app/views/ app/views_tailwind/setup/ app/controllers/setup/ app/javascript/controllers/bulk_assign_modal_controller.js app/views/admin/accounts/edit.html.erb` returns zero matches

**Web/API:**
- [ ] Update `app/controllers/setup/landing_pages_controller.rb` — 12 string replacements (6 `@title` breadcrumbs + 6 flash messages)
- [ ] Update `app/controllers/setup/archived_landing_pages_controller.rb` — 1 `@title` breadcrumb
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/_sidebar.html.erb` — 1 link text
- [ ] Update `app/views_tailwind/setup/_sidebar.html.erb` — 1 link text
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_pages/index.html.erb` — 9 strings
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_pages/new.html.erb` — 1 heading
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_pages/edit.html.erb` — 2 strings
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_pages/show.html.erb` — 3 strings
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_pages/_form.html.erb` — 1 placeholder
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_pages/_section_fields.html.erb` — 1 help text
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_pages/_section_template.html.erb` — 1 help text
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/assigned_landing_pages/_landing_page.html.erb` — 7 strings
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_page_assignments/create.html.erb` — 1 success message
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/landing_page_assignments/_confirm_content.html.erb` — 2 texts
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/archived_landing_pages/index.html.erb` — 6 strings
- [ ] Update `app/views/setup/structures/right_pane.html.erb` — 1 action link text
- [ ] Update `app/views/admin/accounts/edit.html.erb` — 1 feature flag label
- [ ] Update `app/javascript/controllers/bulk_assign_modal_controller.js` — 1 flash message
- [ ] Update `spec/requests/setup/landing_pages_controller_spec.rb` — string expectations
- [ ] Update `spec/requests/setup/archived_landing_pages_controller_spec.rb` — string expectations
- [ ] Update `spec/requests/setup/landing_page_assignments_controller_spec.rb` — string expectations
- [ ] Update `spec/features/setup/landing_pages_spec.rb` — string expectations
- [ ] Run verification grep to confirm zero remaining "landing page" in user-facing files
- [ ] Run full landing pages test suite — all specs pass

**iOS:** N/A — Level 2 (web-only) project
**Android:** N/A — Level 2 (web-only) project

**Dependencies:** M0 (complete)

---

### M2: QA Test Data
**What:** Create a rake task that seeds an account with landing pages data for manual QA verification of the rename.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Rake task `pipeline:seed_rename_landing_pages_to_public_pages` exists in `lib/tasks/pipeline/`
- [ ] Task creates a test account with `landing_pages_enabled: true`
- [ ] Task creates several landing pages (active and archived) with sections and form assignments
- [ ] Task creates structures (sites/areas) with landing page assignments for testing the area assignment UI
- [ ] Task is idempotent (can re-run without duplicating data)
- [ ] Task prints a summary: account credentials, URLs to visit (index, show, edit, archived, area assignment)
- [ ] Manual QA can verify: every page heading, sidebar link, button, flash message, confirm dialog, empty state, and admin setting label says "Public Page(s)" — not "Landing Page(s)"

**Web/API:**
- [ ] `lib/tasks/pipeline/seed_rename_landing_pages_to_public_pages.rake` — idempotent rake task
- [ ] Uses existing factories/builders where available
- [ ] Dev/staging only (no production-unsafe operations)

**iOS:** N/A
**Android:** N/A

**Dependencies:** M1 (needs the renamed strings implemented to QA against)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements Checklist

### Data Model & API
> No data model or API changes. Architecture proposal approved with zero modifications.

- [x] Architecture proposal approved: `projects/rename-landing-pages-to-public-pages/architecture-proposal.md`
- [x] Milestones correctly reference the approved architecture (no data model/API work)
- [x] No contradictions between gameplan and approved architecture

### Security & Access Control
- [x] All queries scoped to account/user — unchanged, no new queries
- [x] Controller authorization in place — unchanged, existing `require_administer_permission`
- [x] Feature permissions respected — unchanged, existing `require_landing_pages_enabled`
- [x] Area-based access respected — unchanged
- [x] API authentication required — N/A, no API changes
- [x] No new attack surfaces — confirmed, string replacements only

### Performance
- [x] N/A — no new queries, no schema changes, zero runtime impact
- [x] No caching changes needed
- [x] No N+1 query risks introduced

### Observability & Debuggability
- [x] N/A — no new logging, metrics, or debug needs for a string rename
- [x] No alerts needed

### Testing Plan

| Type | Coverage | Platform | Owner |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Request specs | Flash messages, redirects, page headings for all CRUD + archive/restore/duplicate actions | Rails | Pipeline |
| Feature specs | End-to-end UI flows: navigation, page headings, buttons, confirm dialogs, empty states | Rails | Pipeline |
| Verification grep | Zero remaining "landing page" strings in user-facing files | Rails | Pipeline |
| Manual QA | Visual walkthrough of all admin screens, confirm dialogs, flash messages | Web | Human |

### Feature Flags & Rollout
- [x] No new feature flag needed — the rename ships within the existing `landing_pages_enabled` flag
- [x] The feature is already in private beta — the rename goes out to all accounts that have the flag enabled
- [x] No phased rollout required — this is a cosmetic change with zero functional impact

### Mobile-Specific
- [x] N/A — Level 2 (web-only) project. No Firebase events, crash reporting, offline behavior, or mobile OS considerations.

### Legacy & Migration
- [x] Old client experience documented — no impact on any API consumer or mobile app
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained — URLs unchanged, no API changes
- [x] No data migration needed

### Export/Reporting
- [x] N/A — no exports reference the feature name

## 5. Dependencies & Risks

| Risk/Dependency | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Missed "Landing Page" string occurrence | Low — user sees inconsistent naming | Post-implementation verification grep catches any misses |
| Test assertions on old strings cause failures | Low — CI goes red until tests updated | Update test assertions as part of M1 (not separate) |
| In-progress work on landing pages feature (other branches) | Low — merge conflict on changed strings | Coordinate with any active landing pages branches; resolve conflicts at merge time |

---

## 6. Release Plan

### Phases

| Phase | What Ships | Flag State | Audience |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Phase 1 (only phase) | M1 + M2 | Existing `landing_pages_enabled` flag — no change | All accounts with feature enabled |

This is a single-phase release. No phased rollout is needed because:
- The change is purely cosmetic (no functional risk)
- The feature is already behind a flag (`landing_pages_enabled`)
- Only beta accounts currently have the flag enabled

### Done Criteria
- [ ] All acceptance criteria in M1 met
- [ ] All landing pages specs passing
- [ ] Verification grep confirms zero remaining "landing page" in user-facing files
- [ ] QA walkthrough confirms all screens show "Public Page(s)"
- [ ] Code merged and deployed to staging

## 7. Estimates

| Milestone | Rails | iOS | Android | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|---------|-------|
| M0: Discovery & Alignment | Done | N/A | N/A | Pipeline Stages 1-2 |
| M1: Rename User-Facing Strings | < 1 day | N/A | N/A | ~20 files, ~51 string replacements + test updates |
| M2: QA Test Data | < 0.5 day | N/A | N/A | Rake task for manual QA |
| **Total** | **< 1 day** | **N/A** | **N/A** | |
