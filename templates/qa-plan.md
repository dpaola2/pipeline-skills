## 3. Test Data Setup

### Rake Task

```bash
cd [primary repo path from pipeline.md Target Repositories]
[run seed task per framework — e.g., bundle exec rake pipeline:seed_[slug]]
```

[If no rake task exists: "No seed task was created for this project. Test data must be set up manually — see scenarios below."]

### Scenarios Seeded

| Scenario | Account/User | Data Created | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| [Happy path] | [credentials] | [what's created] | [what it enables testing] |
| [Empty state] | [credentials] | [what's created] | [what it enables testing] |
| [Edge case] | [credentials] | [what's created] | [what it enables testing] |

### Post-Seed Verification
- [ ] Navigate to [URL] and verify [expected state]
- [ ] Log in as [user] and verify [expected access]
