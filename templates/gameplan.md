**What:** [Brief description]
**Linear:** [LIN-XXX]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [XX-010]: [Criterion]
- [ ] [XX-011]: [Criterion]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [XX-020]: [Criterion]

**[Primary platform from PIPELINE.md]:**
- [ ] [Specific tasks]

**Dependencies:** M1 (needs core implementation)

---

[Continue feature milestones as needed]

---

### M_PENULTIMATE_: QA Test Data
**What:** Create a seed task that populates realistic test data covering all feature scenarios. This enables manual QA without requiring testers to construct their own data. (Task format per `PIPELINE.md` Framework & Stack — e.g., rake task, management command, script.)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Seed task exists in the appropriate location (per `PIPELINE.md` Directory Structure, e.g., seed tasks directory)
- [ ] Task creates test account(s) with appropriate permissions and roles
- [ ] Task seeds data covering: happy path, empty states, edge cases, threshold boundaries
- [ ] Task is idempotent (can re-run without duplicating data)
- [ ] Task prints a summary of what was created (account credentials, key IDs, URLs to test)
- [ ] All scenarios from the manual QA checklist have supporting test data

**[Primary platform from PIPELINE.md]:**
- [ ] Seed task file — idempotent (per PIPELINE.md Framework & Stack Seed command format)
- [ ] Uses existing test data helpers where available
- [ ] No production-unsafe operations (dev/staging only)

**Dependencies:** All prior feature milestones (needs the full feature implemented)

---

### M_LAST_: Empty States, Edge Cases & Polish
**What:** [Implement all empty state messages, handle edge cases, polish UI]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [UI empty state scenarios]
- [ ] [Edge case handling]
- [ ] [Print styles, responsive behavior]

**[Primary platform from PIPELINE.md]:**
- [ ] [View/UI updates]

**Dependencies:** All prior milestones

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements Checklist

### Data Model & API
> These were reviewed and approved in the Architecture Review checkpoint. Reference the approved architecture for details.

- [ ] Architecture proposal approved: [Link]
- [ ] Milestones correctly reference the approved data model and API design
- [ ] No contradictions between gameplan and approved architecture

### Security & Access Control
- [ ] All queries scoped to account/user
- [ ] Controller authorization in place
- [ ] Feature permissions respected
- [ ] Area-based access respected (if applicable)
- [ ] API authentication required
- [ ] No new attack surfaces

### Performance
- [ ] Data volume x access frequency considered
- [ ] Query patterns identified
- [ ] Indexes sufficient
- [ ] Caching needed? [Yes/No]
- [ ] N+1 query risks identified

### Observability & Debuggability
- [ ] Logging plan (events, fields)
- [ ] Logs are human-readable
- [ ] Debug path exists without production access
- [ ] Alerts needed? [Yes/No]

### Analytics & Instrumentation

#### Success Metrics
> How will we know this feature is working? Reference PRD goals or define measurable outcomes.

- [ ] [e.g., "50% of accounts with eligible data use the report within 30 days"]
- [ ] [e.g., "Export usage averages >10 exports/week across all accounts"]
- Or: N/A — no measurable success criteria for this feature

#### Events to Track

| Event Name | Trigger | Key Properties | Platform |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| [e.g., `deficient_report.viewed`] | [User opens the report page] | [account_id, user_id, filter_count] | [Web] |
| [e.g., `deficient_report.exported`] | [User clicks CSV or PDF export] | [format, row_count, filtered] | [Web] |

_If the product has no event tracking infrastructure, note that here and skip the table._

#### Instrumentation Approach
- [ ] Framework: [e.g., "Ahoy events", "server-side logging", "Mixpanel", "custom analytics table", "none — no tracking infrastructure yet"]
- [ ] Implementation location: [e.g., "Controller after_action callbacks", "Stimulus event handlers", "service layer"]

### Testing Plan

| Type | Coverage | Platform | Owner |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Model/unit tests | [What's covered] | [Primary platform from PIPELINE.md] | Pipeline |
| Request/integration tests | [What's covered] | [Primary platform from PIPELINE.md] | Pipeline |
| System/E2E tests | [What's covered] | [Primary platform from PIPELINE.md] | Pipeline |
| Manual QA | [Key scenarios] | All | Human |

> Add rows for additional active platforms from PIPELINE.md Platforms if Level 3.

### Feature Flags & Rollout
- [ ] Feature flag: `[flag_name]`
- [ ] Default: Off
- [ ] Beta flag for select accounts
- [ ] Rollout plan: [phases]

### Mobile-Specific
<!-- CONDITIONAL: Include only if PIPELINE.md Platforms lists mobile platforms (iOS, Android). Otherwise omit. -->
- [ ] Mobile analytics events planned
- [ ] Crash reporting considerations
- [ ] Offline behavior defined (if applicable)
- [ ] Min OS version implications

### Legacy & Migration

## 6. Release Plan

### Phases

| Phase | What Ships | Flag State | Audience |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | [Milestones M1-M2] | Beta ON for test accounts | Internal |
| Phase 2 | [All milestones] | Beta ON for select customers | Beta customers |
| Phase 3 | [GA] | Feature ON for all | All customers |

### Done Criteria
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Feature flag enabled for beta accounts
- [ ] Observability in place
- [ ] QA sign-off

---

## 7. Estimates

| Milestone | Size | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| M0: Discovery | Done | Pipeline Stages 0-2 |
| M1: [Name] | S / M / L / XL | |
| M2: [Name] | S / M / L / XL | |
| M3: [Name] | S / M / L / XL | |

**Size guide:** S = 1-3 files, no migrations, no new patterns. M = 5-10 files, simple migration, follows existing conventions. L = 10-20 files, complex migrations, new patterns. XL = 20+ files, should probably be split.
