## 4. Non-Functional Requirements Checklist

### Data Model & API
> These were reviewed and approved in the Architecture Review checkpoint. Reference the approved architecture for details.

- [ ] Architecture proposal approved: [Link]
- [ ] Milestones correctly reference the approved data model and API design
- [ ] No contradictions between gameplan and approved architecture

### Security & Access Control
- [ ] All queries scoped to account/user
- [ ] Controller authorization in place
- [ ] Feature permissions respected
- [ ] Area-based access respected (if applicable)
- [ ] API authentication required
- [ ] No new attack surfaces

### Performance
- [ ] Data volume x access frequency considered
- [ ] Query patterns identified
- [ ] Indexes sufficient
- [ ] Caching needed? [Yes/No]
- [ ] N+1 query risks identified

### Observability & Debuggability
- [ ] Logging plan (events, fields)
- [ ] Logs are human-readable
- [ ] Debug path exists without production access
- [ ] Metrics/analytics (what to track)
