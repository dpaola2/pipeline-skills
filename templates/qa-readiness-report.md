## 3. Manual Testing Required

> These items need human verification. They are either too complex to automate, involve UI/UX judgment, or require real-device testing.

### High Priority (Must Test)

- [ ] **[Test scenario 1]**
  - Steps: [1, 2, 3]
  - Expected: [What should happen]
  - Platforms: [Which to test on]

- [ ] **[Test scenario 2]**
  - Steps: [1, 2, 3]
  - Expected: [What should happen]
  - Platforms: [Which to test on]

### Medium Priority (Should Test)

- [ ] **[Test scenario]**
  - [Details]

### Low Priority (Nice to Test)

- [ ] **[Test scenario]**
  - [Details]

### Cross-Platform Consistency Checks

- [ ] Create [entity] on iOS → verify visible on Android and Web
- [ ] Create [entity] on Android → verify visible on iOS and Web
- [ ] Create [entity] on Web → verify visible on iOS and Android
- [ ] Edit on one platform → verify changes reflected on all platforms
- [ ] Delete on one platform → verify removed from all platforms

## 4. Backwards Compatibility

### Compatibility Matrix (Verified)

| Feature | Web | iOS (current) | iOS (v[old]) | Android (current) | Android (v[old]) |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [Feature 1] | OK | OK | [Status] | OK | [Status] |

### Scenarios to Verify with Old App Versions

- [ ] [Scenario with old iOS app]
- [ ] [Scenario with old Android app]
- [ ] API responses don't break old parsers

## 5. Feature Flags

| Flag | Name | Default | How to Enable |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
| Feature flag | `[flag_name]` | OFF | [Admin panel / Rails console / etc.] |
| Beta flag | `[beta_flag_name]` | OFF | [How to enable for specific accounts] |

### Testing with Flags

- Test with flag **OFF**: existing behavior should be unchanged
- Test with flag **ON**: new feature should work as specified
- Test flag **toggle**: turning off mid-use should [defined behavior]

---

## 6. Known Limitations

- [Limitation 1 - deferred to future work]
- [Limitation 2 - known trade-off, accepted in spec review]
- [Out of scope items from PRD that users might expect]

---

## 7. Test Data Setup

### Prerequisites
- [ ] [Test account needed with specific configuration]
- [ ] [Seed data requirements]
- [ ] [Feature flag enabled on test accounts]

### Test Accounts

| Account | Purpose | Flag Status |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [Account name] | [What to test] | [ON/OFF] |

### Setup Steps
1. [Step 1: e.g., "Enable feature flag for test account"]
2. [Step 2: e.g., "Create a checklist with line items"]
3. [Step 3: e.g., "Log into iOS app with test credentials"]

## 8. Rollback Plan

**If critical issues found:**

1. **Immediate:** Turn off feature flag → feature hidden from all users
2. **If data issues:** [Describe rollback migration or data fix]
3. **Impact of rollback:** [What happens to data created while feature was ON]
