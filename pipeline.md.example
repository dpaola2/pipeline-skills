# Pipeline Configuration — [Product Name]

> Maps this pipeline instance to target repositories for [Product Name].
> To activate: `cp pipelines/[product-name].md pipeline.md`

## Target Repositories

(REQUIRED — where does the code live?)

| Repository | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Primary | `/path/to/your/repo` | [e.g., Rails web app, Node.js API] |

> Each repository listed here should have a `PIPELINE.md` at its root with repo-specific config
> (branch conventions, framework, directory structure, test commands, guardrails, and any optional
> sections like API conventions or multi-tenant security).
>
> The primary repository's `PIPELINE.md` is the one skills read most — it has the framework details,
> directory structure, and implementation order that drive Stages 1-7.
